These are drafts that I work on in my free time, unless otherwise noted. You may read them, but do not expect them to be finished, or free of errors and plot holes. I write them using [Draft](https://draftin.com).

You can find character profiles [here](characters).

## [Test My Fire](http://tmf.withdraft.com)

(Her)

He killed my parents, not to mention dozens of other people. He’s only known by the Phantom but I will uncover his identity and make him pay. I’m good at this game and I’ll play it till I die. The Phantom thinks he’s good, but he hasn’t met me yet. I play with fire, live in it really. That’s why I’m called the Phoenix Fox. The fire may burn me, but I will extinguish it before it can kill me.

(Him)

Yes, I’m a killer, and I’m good at it. Hundreds have tried to find me, none have succeeded, and that’s the way I like it. I wasn’t named “The Phantom’’ for nothing. Those who have gotten close I’ve gotten rid of, all except the cunning little spy known as the Phoenix Fox. She was at my brother’s party, and now she’s in my head. I should kill her, I really should. She’s gotten too close and she knows it. She keeps toying with me, jumping in and out of the crossfire. Likewise, she’s good at the game, but I’m better. The clock is ticking, and I’m good at waiting. I know she’ll come to me, they always do. And when she does, I’ll take care of her too. Here, little fox, come test my fire.

## [Dear Diary...](http://dear-diary.withdraft.com)

All Sasha wanted to do was finish school, get a job she loved, get married, and start a family. Unfortunately, getting past school seems impossible. Between staying on track with her studies and keeping up with her other activities, graduation couldn’t be farther away. But then the Stone’s show up.

Caden Stone is… hot. That’s the only way Sasha can describe him without sounding like an idiot. He’s just the guy she should avoid, one that likes trouble. Avoiding him isn’t that hard, even though he watches her every day and makes her skin crawl. Yeah, avoiding Caden would be a great idea if she wanted to keep her virginity. Too bad Jennifer, Caden’s half-sister, has other plans.

Jennifer Stone is that blond brat that everyone has met at least once and either befriends her immediately or loathes her forever. She wasn’t really a problem until she decided she wanted to uncover all of Sasha’s past and reveal every little secret, and that’s ignoring the fact that she seems to want to hook Sasha up with Caden for God knows why.

Sasha has a lot of secrets, and they’re kept that way for very good reasons. Those secrets can kill, and there are people who would kill for them. If Sasha doesn’t stop Jennifer, there’s going to be a war and the whole town might get destroyed in the crossfire.

## [Past Nightmares. Present Ghosts. Future Fears.](http://pnpgff.withdraft.com)

Homicide Detective Jared Clemmings has been working with the Boise Police Department for six years at the top of his class. He grew up on the streets and has connections in nearly every corner. There's no other job he'd rather have and no other place he'd rather live.

Reila Pru is tired of running around the country to escape her past ghosts, and Boise, Idaho looks like the perfect place to finally settle down and enjoy life. Unfortunately, ghosts always return to haunt you until they're put to rest, and she has some big and scary ones.

Together, the two get tangled up in kidnappings, murders, and political scandals that all seem to be dangerously connected. Someone, somewhere, is using them to reveal secrets that have been laid down for years and are tangled in ways that effects the whole city, and maybe even the entire country. The keys to unlock and untangle all of them lie in Reila Pru's past and connections, if she has the courage to face those ghosts and find them.
