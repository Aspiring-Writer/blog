At age 434, Azura watched [Vulas Farwynn](../vulas-farwynn) murder her family and her entire race. Since that night, she has vowed revenge on the High Lord of the Shadow Court. She plans to make him watch his family suffer, just as he had done to her father.

At age 694, Azura was captured by [Válgr](../valgr), a being who recognized her for what she was and sought to use her for his own agenda. Azura found herself bound and controlled by the bearer of a ring, a ring that was linked to the bracelets and anklets an old friend had given her. Despite this, she still found ways to defy Válgr. The two may have a common enemy, but Azura has made it clear that she is only interested in punishing the guilty ones, not an entire race.

Her first encounter with Vulas's son, [Faelynn](../faelyn-farwynn), has her questioning her plans. Faelyn is... unique. She isn't sure what it is about the young lord that fascinates her, but he is different from his father. She keeps telling herself that she is only interested in the fae because of his father, only her mind, and her body, hint at the real truth she doesn't want to accept. The son of the fae who slaughtered her family, her entire race, *cannot* be her soulmate. It is impossible. Yet, denying the thin bonds that tie her to him is no easy task, nor can they exist for another reason.
