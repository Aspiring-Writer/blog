At age 434, Azura watched [Vulas Farwynn](../vulas-farwynn) murder her family and her entire race. Since that night, she has vowed revenge on the High Lord of the Shadow Court. She plans to make him watch his family suffer, just as he had done to her father.

At 794, Azura was captured by [Válgr](../valgr), a being who recognized her for what she was and sought to use her for his own agenda. Azura found herself bound and controlled by the bearer of a ring, a ring that was linked to the bracelets and anklets an old friend had given her. Despite this, she still found ways to defy Válgr. The two may have a common enemy, but Azura has made it clear that she is only interested in punishing the guilty ones, not an entire race.
