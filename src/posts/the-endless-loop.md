I wince as another rock hit my skin.

I feel like it left a mark

So I check, but find none.

They didn't use to hurt so much,

They were smaller, too.

At first, they were pebbles

And I could easily shake 'em off

Or ignore them completely

But they've gotten bigger and faster

And they demand my attention.

I fear that one day they will be so big

They will kill me.

***

Flash forward a while,

Not much has changed.

I'm still getting hit.

But now, they seem smaller,

Or maybe I'm too numb.

Perhaps my nerves are frozen,

Or my brain just isn't working.

I don't recognize how I feel,

Or who I am.

Sometimes I wonder,

Why am I fighting again?

What's the purpose?

Where's the end?

Why fight this endless battle,

When I never win?

Even winning looks like losing now,

I can't see the benefit.

An endless loop is all I see.

An endless loop that traps me.

I can't escape it;

Doesn't matter where I go.

It follows me everywhere,

Maybe I'm just slow.

What's the purpose of this show?

I forgot, but maybe you know.

Will it end?

Will the ending be great?

I don't know anymore,

Nor do I seem to care.

I don't feel much,

Besides anger and fear.

Oh, let's not forget loneliness,

He seems like the star this year.

Maybe that's why the rocks don't hurt me.

It's hard to feel much

When you're broke and alone.

Then again, maybe that's the name of this show.
