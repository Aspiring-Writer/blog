    "bio": "I'm a nineteen-year-old,  homeschooled, Christian student who is struggling to stay motivated and finish things. I love Jesus, pretty much any yarn crafts (crochet, knitting, macrame, been there done that), reading, writing, music, horses, developing websites (new at that), FOSS, and anything Linux (I'm not a complete tech geek but I definitely see myself getting there ðŸ˜Š). I'm very social, which isn't a very good thing since I trust people too easily ðŸ˜‰, but I'm getting better. I open my mouth a lot before thinking, but as I said, I'm getting better. I procrastinate way too much but prayerfully I will learn some self-control and apply it everywhere in my life (starting with my mouthðŸ˜‹).",
