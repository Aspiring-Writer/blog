summary: Juggling school AND a job can be super, super stressful. For me, school
  is enough to make me lose my mind because I am not an organized person to
  begin with. Adding a job, even though it's very flexible, is definitely going
  to be tricky. Time to finally sit down and gather everything I've learned to
  find what works for me.

To start off, I thought it would be good to split this long post into a few sections. Now, this post will probably be updated as I move through the year(s) so look out for those callouts.

First off we are going to be starting with school since that usually comes before a job. Anyway, if you're like me, you have looked at dozens of videos online about how to plan your school year and stay organized because you know you need too. And you probably got overwhelmed and stressed out while watching those videos and gathering these huge nuggets of wisdom that you had no idea how you would actually use them. Yup, been there, done that, and so have thousands of others.

You don't need to beat yourself up for having the urge to get organized and not knowing how to do it. On the flip side, you should probably stop spending hours on social media watching productivity videos and start being productive!

My point is simple, I've been there, and I still am. The whole purpose of this post is to encourage you and help you figure out how to organize your life and increase your productivity. Here are my tips.

## 1. Discover Your Personality Type and Find Your Learning Method

This is really important because it will help you understand what type of person and learner you are. This seemingly small detail could be exactly what's slowing you down and adding to your frustration! And it's an easy fix. No, really, it is!

To discover your personality type, I would proudly recommend [16 Personalities.](www.16personalities.com) 16Personalities gives you a really good, in-depth, ten-minute quiz to discover what kind of person you are. It's recommended by a bunch of people, schools, and organizations. And it really works! I have learned things about myself that I didn't even know, and it all helped me understand me. Finding your personality will help you discover your learning type, strengths and weaknesses, career types, job environment, and the type of friends that work best for you (including lovers!). I'm telling you, taking the 16Personalities quiz will be such a big help.

As with all these types of quizzes, take the time to answer the questions truthfully. If you're struggling with one question, just pick the first thing that popped into your head. If you have a sibling or someone who knows really well, you could ask them for help; but remember, no one knows you like you and God do, period.

## 2. Start Planning and Organizing!!!
